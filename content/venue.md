## Getting to Belfast Castle

#### ðŸš– By Taxi

Approximately 10â€“15 minutes from Belfast city centre (Â£8â€“Â£12).

Easy to book via Value Cabs, Fon-A-Cab, or Uber. Do allow additional time in the mornings, as traffic congestion can significantly increase travel time, especially near 9am.

While Uber services are usually well served in the Belfast city centre, you may experience difficulty getting an Uber from Belfast Castle. It is advisable to pre-book a local taxi or Uber if you anticipate needing transport from the venue.

We will be helping to carpool, as we know some delegates are staying at specific city centre hotels (please reach out for more information). The [Lansdowne Hotel](https://www.thelansdownehotel.co.uk/) is closest to the venue, but does involve a steep walk.

#### ðŸšŒ By Bus

[Metro Bus 1](https://trn-prd-cdn-01.azureedge.net/mediacontainer/medialibraries/translink/route-maps/metro/metro1.pdf) (1A, 1B, 1C) from Donegall Place (city centre) to Antrim Road.

Get off at Strathmore Park and enjoy a scenic walk (~18 minutes uphill) to the castle.

#### ðŸš— By Car

Free parking available at Belfast Castle.

From city centre: Drive north on Antrim Road (A6), follow signs for Belfast Castle.

Maps: search for Belfast Castle Car Park 3. There are additional car parks nearby if Car Park 3 is full.

For those with Disability Parking Permits: accessible parking bays are available outside the main doors of Belfast Castle.

Note: The castle sits on a hill within Cave Hill Country Park, so bring comfortable shoes if you fancy exploring a bit.
