# Visa Information

Depending on your nationality, you may require a visa to travel to the United Kingdom (UK), which includes Northern Ireland. It is your responsibility to check your visa requirements and obtain the appropriate travel documents in advance.

### Important Notes:

* Northern Ireland is part of the United Kingdom, and UK visa rules apply.
* If you are entering via Dublin Airport (Republic of Ireland), you must ensure you have the correct visas to enter Ireland and to cross into Northern Ireland (e.g. you may need to obtain visas from both Ireland and the United Kingdom).
* A Republic of Ireland visa is not valid for travel into Northern Ireland or the rest of the UK.
* Visa processing times can vary, so we recommend applying well in advance of your travel dates.
